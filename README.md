\# Audio Compressor – MATLAB App Designer



A real-time audio compressor implemented in \*\*MATLAB App Designer\*\*, designed as a final academic project.  

The application allows users to load audio samples, apply dynamic range compression, and visualize the processed signal in real time.

\## 🎛️ Features

\- Real-time audio playback and processing

\- Configurable \*\*compression ratios\*\*

\- \*\*Threshold\*\* control

\- Optional \*\*make-up gain\*\*

\- Waveform visualization (input vs. output)

\- Simple and intuitive GUI built with MATLAB App Designer



\## 🧠 Technical Overview

The compressor dynamically reduces the dynamic range of an audio signal by attenuating signals that exceed a predefined threshold.  

Different compression ratios are supported, allowing the user to control how aggressively the signal is compressed.



The project focuses on:

\- Digital audio signal processing

\- Dynamic range compression principles

\- GUI-based interaction with audio algorithms



\## 🛠️ Technologies Used

\- MATLAB

\- App Designer

\- Audio Toolbox



\## 📂 Project Structure

\- `wavPlayer\_compressor.mlapp` – Main App Designer application

\- `\*.wav` – Example audio samples for testing

\- `.prj / .mlappinstall` – MATLAB project and app packaging files



\## ▶️ How to Run

1\. Open MATLAB

2\. Open `wavPlayer\_compressor.mlapp` in App Designer

3\. Run the app

4\. Load an audio file and adjust compression parameters

\## 🚀 Motivation

This project was developed as part of an academic final project to combine \*\*audio signal processing\*\* with \*\*interactive software design\*\*, emphasizing clean structure, usability, and real-time behavior.
